# Breast Cancer Analysis 

Link to datasource: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset/data

**Requirements**

1. python 

2. matplotlib

3. seaborn

4. numpy

5. pandas

**Context**

This project utilizes a breast cancer dataset from Kaggle from the University of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences
Center. The authors sourced this dataset from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. (Link to source: https://data.world/health/breast-cancer-wisconsin)

The objective of this project is to find correlations between tumors and their size and texture (smoothness) 
 To determine whether or not the tumor is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). 

**File Dictionary**

1. ***ID:*** Identification of the Patient 

2. ***Diagnosis:*** Diagnosis of the tumor, "M" for malignant/cancerous, "B" for benign/not cancerous

3. ***Radius:*** Mean of the distances from the center to points on the perimeter

4. ***Texture:*** Standard deviation of gray-scale values

5. ***Perimeter:*** Perimeter of tumor (in millimeters)

6. ***Area:*** Area of tumor (in millimeters squared)

7. ***Smoothness:*** Local variation in radius length

8. ***Compactness:*** Calculated by perimeter^2 / area - 1.0

9. ***Concavity:*** Severity of concave portions of the contour

10. ***Concave Points:*** Number of concave portions of the contour

11. ***Symmetry:*** Symmetry of the tumor

12. ***Fractal Dimension:*** Coastline approximation
